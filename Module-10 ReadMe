        - Module Objectives:
            1- Evaluate exception handling options
            2- Catch runtime errors with try/catch
            3- use global exception handler
            4- Implement failure functions for async operations

        - there are several options when implementing exception handling:
            1- prevent the error entirely
            2- catch the exception
            3- notify the user
            4- log information about the exception

        - the most common way to catch exception in angular applications are with
        try/catch block
        - or you can use global exception handler: $exceptionHandler
        - or you can use failure functions
