1-adding another route state:
    -to create a new state [module 4] we moved in 4 steps:
        1- build the view template
        2- optionally create the controller
        3- configure the state
        4- activate the state

2-

    - in previous module you have learned "$stateProvider" service
    $stateProvider.state("productList",{
                         url: "/products",
                         templateUrl: "app/products/productListView.html",
                         controller: "ProductListCtrl as vm"

                         where "productList" is the state name

    })

    - another useful property beside url, templateUrl, and Controller is "resolve"
    - Resolve:
        - a property that can be attached to a route
        - can provide the controller with data
        - identify dependencies that can be used or injected into the controller,
        if the dependecy is a promise, the promise is resolved before the controller
        is instaniated and route is changed, this means if the code is retreieving data
        it waits for the data to return before navigating to the associated route displaying the view
        and this will simply the controller because it will not need to fetch data.
        - these dependencies is defined with key/value pairs, where "key" is the name of the dependency,
        and the value can be a string that define the name of the service that can be injected, also
        the "value" can be a function
        - we need resolve to retrieve the data for the product detail view.

        $stateProvider.state("productDetail",{
                              utl: "/products/:productId",
                              templateUrl: "app/products/productDetailView.html",
                              controller: "ProductDetailCtrl as vm",
                              resolve: {
                                    productResource: "productResource", //it define dependency on "productResource" (string name of the service) service that you have created
                                    product: function(productResource, $stateParams) // it define a dependecy on the result of the defined function
                                                {
                                                var productId = $stateParams.productId;
                                                return productResource.get({productId: productId}).$promise;

                                                }
                                        }
                              })

                              - "$stateParams" service is part of UI router, it is a service that is populated by current state parameters
                              - this service is needed because "productdetail" state has a productId parameter
                              - when the product is returned from the service, the state is activated, the controller is constructed,
                              and the product dependency is injected into the controller, then the view in the "templateUrl" is displayed
        })
