1- Module 2 Objectives:
    a- turn business requirements into a View, Model and Controller.
    b- Organise the project structure.
    c- build the View using the appropriate directives.
    d- define the main Module of the application.
    e- Build the Controller.
    f- Define the Model.
    g- Implement the methods for the action on the page.
    h- Style the view with bootstrap.
    i- make sure that basic knowledge of angular is understood.


a- turn business requirements into a "View", "Model", and "Controller":
    - first step is to collect the requirements.
    - use this requirements to details appropriate user stories.
    - sample of the user stories:
        - As a product manager, i can:
            - "Browse" the list of products.
            - See the product "images".
            - "Select" a product to "view" details.
            - "Select" a product to "edit" details.
    - from these user stories we will generate mocked up "user interface" design [check the video]
    - from point 1-a we need to turn above user stories into "View", "Model", and "Controller".
    - the "View" will be the user interface design.
    - the "Model" will be the JSON file that hold the data for us.
    - the "Controller" will define the "data" and the "code" of the actions of the views.

    - the Controller roles are:
        1- Define the "Model" required by the "View", so the "Controller" contains the Views-Model.
            - retrieve the products, achieved by calling back end web service
        2- Implements the "Method" for any action that the "View" can perform
            - Implement the method responsible for Hide/Show Images.


b- Organising the project structure:
    - app directory:
        - contains the code specific to this application
        - has subdirectory for each primary feature in the app
    - common directory:
        - contains the code common to all parts of the application
        - "service" subdirectory define the location of common services or BL services

    - Css directory
    - fonts directory
    - images directory
    - js directory
        - for external java script files like "angular.js" or any other third party library
    - index.html:
        - contain all of the references, and launching point for our application

c- build the View using the appropriate directives.
    - in general the "View" refer to user interface in the app
    - it is used to describe both the HTML that contain the user interface markup and page generated from this html
    - some angular js documentation make a distinction:
        - a piece of html that contains user interface markup and angular directives is called a "template"
        - the loaded and transferred nad rendered result is called the "View" or "live template".
    finally: if you want to build full featured angular app we need to define that app using a "Module".

d- define the main Module of the application.
    - it defines an angular application
    - most angular app has one main module, but they can reference any number of other module.
    - it tracks all of the application code, that can be done using "registration process", each
      piece of application code is built, it can register itself in the module.
    - track all dependencies for the application
    - keeps the application modularized
    ANGULAR MODULE METHOD:
        angular.module("productManagement", [])
        - when defining a module, the module method required 2 parameters
            - first is the "module name"
            - array of dependencies [reference to any other module or library that this module uses known also as "injectables"
            because angular injects them into the parts of the application that needs them]
            - the above syntax is know as "setter method", because it is the syntax to define or set
            angular module

        angular.module("productManagement");
            - this is with one parameter not 2 as previous
            - this useful when registering other code, such as controller
            - it is called getter method for angular module, because it is used to get the reference to that module

        - the module is defined in a file called app.js
