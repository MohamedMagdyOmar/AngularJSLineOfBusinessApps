Module-4:
    - "Routing" is a technique for navigating between views.
    - each route represents a specific view.
    - activating a route navigates to that view
    - one way to define a route is using Url
    - the portion of the Url prefix with "#" symbol define fragment identifier
    - angular routing takes the advantage of the fact that the fragment identifier is processed by the client,
    so you can assign a unique fragment identifier to each view, and navigate to that fragment to display this view.
    - the fragment identifier is uniquely identifying a routing state not a physical resource.
    - for example:
        - say you have a "Menu", and from that menu you need to navigate to the "welcome page",
        or to the "product list" view.
        - you can identify a default route to the "welcome page" using just slash "/"
            route:/
            ex: http://www.mysite.com/.../#/

        - you can identify the route to the "product list" view using "/products"
            route:/products
            ex: http://www.mysite.com/.../#/products

    - angular provides 2 different routing frameworks:
        1- ngRoute
        2- UIRouter

    -ngRoute:
        - based on URL fragment identifiers
        - each route has:
            - "Url" fragment identifier.
            - view template [that is displayed when navigating to this Url]
            - optional controller

    - UI Router:
        - based on application states
        - each state has:
            - optional Url fragment identifier
            - view template
            - optional controller
            - additional attached behavior

    Module adjectives:
        1- define a site map
        2- layout the layout template
        3- configure the routing
        4- build a menu with routing
        5- build a default view
        6- use to resolve to preload data
        7- define a nested routing states for a wizard
