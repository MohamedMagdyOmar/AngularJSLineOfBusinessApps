8- Defining Business Logic in an Angular Service
    - angular services is Angular code that can be used to:
        - organize application logic
        - Encapsulate logic not directly related to a view or model
        - share logic (or data) across the application

    - Services can be:
        - injected into any controller or other service
        - make it easily to use

    - services are:
        - lazily instantiated
        - singletons -> each component that depends on the service gets the same instance of the service,
        so you can keep data around of the life time of the application

    - built-in vs custom services:
        -built-in services:
            - prefixed with a $
            -examples :$http, $resource, $httpbackend
        custom services:
            -service mthod -> definesa function that can be constructed
            - factory method -> function that can be invked

    - Factory Method:
        - register the service using the factory method:
            - name
            - factory function

            to register a service:
                angular.module("common.services")
                .factory("productsService", // service name
                          productsService)  // service factory function

                function productService(){

                }

    - steps for Creating a Custom Service:
        1- Create a new Javascript file
        2- insert a script tag into index.html
        3- register the service with a module
        4- write the service factory function
