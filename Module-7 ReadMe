Validation Forms:

Introduction:
    - Validation Techniques:
        - Type Attribute -> .type="email"
        - Required Attribute -> .required
        - Angular Validation Attributes -> .ng-minlength
        - custom angular directive -> .my-directive=""
        - code in the controller -> .if{}

    - Module Objectives:
        - Prepare the Form for validation
        - Identify required fields
        - Mark Invalid Elements
        - Display Messages
        - Use angular validation attributes
        - Prevent Submit


- Prepare the Form for validation:
    - Ensure the form has a name, that name is used to reference the control on the form from angular
        <form class="form-horizontal" name="productForm">

    - Set the novalidate attribute, this turns off browser built in validation, and allows angular to handle the validation instead.
        <form class="form-horizontal" name="productForm" novalidate>

    - on all previous modules we were using basic html tags like "form" tag shown above,
    to create a data entry form in angular app, angular has set of directives that replace standard html elements.


- Identify required fields

- Mark Invalid Elements:
    - mark invalid elements relies on 3 features:
        1- ngClass directive
        2- bootstrap styles
        3- angular validation states

        eg: ng-class="{'has-error':
                productForm.inputProductName.$invalid}"

                - has-error -> is bootstrap styles
                - $invalid -> angular validation states

        - ngClass Directive:
            - allows sets a css class dynamically, based on an expression that defines the style classes
            - the expression can be:
                - "A string" contain space delimited class names
                - "An Array" whose elements are string contain space delimited class names
                - "An Object Literal" define a set of key value pairs eg: ng-class="{'has-error':productForm.inputProductName.$invalid}"
                in this example the "key" is 'has-error' it is the name of the bootsTrap style class
                "value" is an expression that is evaluated in this example productForm.inputProductName.$invalid

                if the expression is truth the class name defined in the "key" is applied to the element


        - Bootstrap validation styles:
            - bootstrap provides several validation styles:
                - .has-success style
                - .has-warning style
                - .has-error style

        - angular validation states:
            - angular provides a number of validation states.
                - $pristine -> entry has not been changed
                - $dirty -> entry hs been changed
                - $valid -> entry is valid based on defined validation for the element
                - $invalid -> entry is invalid based on defined validation for the element
                - $error -> - all validations and whether they are valid or invalid
                            - it is a set of key value pair
                            - "key" is the name of validation role applied to the element
                            - "Value" is a boolean, false -> if validation role is broken


            - in order to use "angular validation states" in the form there are some pre-requisites:
                1- form must have a name
                2- input element must have a name
                3- input element must include ngModel

- Display Messages:
    - there are many ways to display a validation messages:
        1- Alert Box (Not Good) because it interrupts user entry flow, as the user has to respond immediately to the alert
        2- validate message area in the form
        3- adjacent to the input element

    to display error message:
        <span class="help-block has-error"
                ng-show="productForm.inputProductName.$invalid"> Product name is required</span>


- Angular Validation Directives
    -ng-minlength -> min required length
    -ng-maxlength
    -ng-pattern -> validates an entry against certain pattern expression
    -ng-change -> allows the definition of an expression that is evaluated when the content of input elements is changed, this allows custom validation code

    -show different messages for diff error:
        1-
            - ng-messages
            - it is directives that shows or hides messages based on key value pair
            - similar to a switch or case statement

            - ng-message
            -it directive that defines specific cases
            -not available until angular 1.3
            <span class="help-block has-error">
            <span ng-messages="productForm.pn.$error">
                <span ng-message="required">required</span>
                <span ng-message="minlength">min of 4 chars</span>
                <span ng-message="maxlength">max of 12 chars</span>
            </span>

        2- using ng-show:
          <span class="help-block has-error"
            <span ng-show="productForm.inputProductName.$error.required"> Product Name is Required</span>
            <span ng-show="productForm.inputProductName.$error.minlength"> must be 4 char</span>
            <span ng-show="productForm.inputProductName.$error.maxlength"> can not exceed 12 chars</span>
          </span>
