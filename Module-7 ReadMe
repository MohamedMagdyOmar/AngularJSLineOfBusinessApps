Validation Forms:

Introduction:
    - Validation Techniques:
        - Type Attribute -> .type="email"
        - Required Attribute -> .required
        - Angular Validation Attributes -> .ng-minlength
        - custom angular directive -> .my-directive=""
        - code in the controller -> .if{}

    - Module Objectives:
        - Prepare the Form for validation
        - Identify required fields
        - Mark Invalid Elements
        - Display Messages
        - Use angular validation attributes
        - Prevent Submit


- Prepare the Form for validation:
    - Ensure the form has a name, that name is used to reference the control on the form from angular
        <form class="form-horizontal" name="productForm">

    - Set the novalidate attribute, this turns off browser built in validation, and allows angular to handle the validation instead.
        <form class="form-horizontal" name="productForm" novalidate>

    - on all previous modules we were using basic html tags like "form" tag shown above,
    to create a data entry form in angular app, angular has set of directives that replace standard html elements.

    - this replacement done automatically
