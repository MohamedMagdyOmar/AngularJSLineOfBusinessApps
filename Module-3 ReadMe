- Module 3 objectives:
    a - understand how data is retrieved
    b - evaluate existing angular services for calling web service
    c - build a reusable data access component
    d - modify the controller to retrieve data
    e - fake it without the web service

a - understand how data is retrieved.
    - angular do not have direct access to corp resources
    - so it need needed data from web services
    - any web service that return json can work with angular app


c - build a reusable data access component:
    - we need to put the code that retrieve the data in reusable component, because several diff parts
    of the application will need to access data
    - in angualr the recommened way to build reusable component is to create a second "module",
    and in that module create custom services containing the reusable code.

    - we will define the reusable data access compenent by building firstly a seperate module
    that we will call "Common.Services"
    - the code to create this module:
        angular.module("common.services",["ngResource"])
        we use $resource to interact with web server
    - once the "module" is built we are ready to build the custom service.
    - we need to register this service with the common services module.
    - the code looks like:
        angular.module("common.services").factory("productResource",["$resource, productResource"])
